// This is testing that dependent dialects are explicitly loaded. ExportVerilog
// must explicitly load any dialect that it creates operations for. For this
// test to work as intended:
//   1. the IR must not have any operations from the SV dialect
//   2. the IR must trigger ExportVerilog to create a sv.wire

  // Check that a wire temporary is created by export verilog. This wire is
  // for holding the value of %0.  If this wire is not emitted then this test
  // should either be deleted or find a different way to force IR generation.

  // CHECK: wire _GEN;
