    A pass which does a simple `arith` to `comb` mapping wherever possible.

    This **does not** intend to be the definitive lowering/HLS pass of `arith`
    operations in CIRCT (hence the name "map" instead of e.g. "lower").
    Rather, it provides a simple way (mostly for testing purposes) to map
    `arith` operations.

    The order successors are merged together mirrors the order different control
    paths are created. Thus, each block with two successors will have a corresponding
    merge block.

    This pass brings the CFG into a canonical form for further transformations.

    Treats loops and sub-CFGs with irregular control flow like single blocks.

    ensures that every value used within a block is also defined within the

    semantics. The pass achieves this by adding block arguments wherever
    necessary to forward values to the block(s) where they are used.
